  <h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
  <p> Sam was here</p>
  <p>The most ridiculous rule i've ever heard is that my friend's parents
    told her that she wasn't allowed to have a phone until college.
  <h2>They Meant It</h2>
  <p>She still doesn't have a phone, and is a sophomore in highschool now.
    At least they have a home phone or I would never be able to talk to her.
